# Guide to formatting non-animated skins

- This is ONLY for skins that share animations with the default skin. This doesn't need to be done for models that will be animated. It also doesn't need to be done for texture skins (skins where the texture/color is applied to the default skin).
- Basically, if you're creating a skin for `X` tower, you need to match the names of parts to the corresponding part in the default skin. Ask me (Atrazine) for the default skin of the tower you're working on.
- I'll use the John tower and the Eradicator John skin as an example in this guide.

If your skin will share animations with the default skin, **no welds are required at any point!** If you're welding something, you're probably doing something wrong.
