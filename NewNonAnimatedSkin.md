# Guide to formatting non-animated skins
- This is ONLY for skins that share animations with the default skin. This doesn't need to be done for models that will be animated. It also doesn't need to be done for texture skins (skins where the texture/color is applied to the default skin).
- Basically, if you're creating a skin for `X` tower, you need to match the names of parts to the corresponding part in the default skin. Ask me (Atrazine) for the default skin of the tower you're working on.
- I'll use the John tower and the Eradicator John skin as an example in this guide.
- If your skin will share animations with the default skin, **no welds are required at any point!** If you're welding something, you're probably doing something wrong.

## First-time steps
- Please install this plugin I have created: ![link](TDX_Plugin_Lite.rbxmx). The download button is in the top right corner:

- To install the plugin locally, first insert the .rbxm you have downloaded. This can be done by going to the "MODEL" tab and inserting a model.

- Next, right click on the plugin you just inserted, and click "Save as Local Plugin":

- You should see several commands in a UI in the bottom of the screen:

- You can minimize/reopen the UI by pressing Ctrl+Shift+T at any time. Let me know if there are any bugs with the plugin.

## Example skin set
As mentioned previously, we'll be using the John Eradicator skin as an example:

In the image, the models labeled (1.) are the unformatted models. The models labeled (2.) are the formatted models. The models labeled (3.) are the default skin models.
